# Ensure plaintext is removed from output IR (no literal "SecretString")
CHECK-NOT: SecretString

# Optionally ensure some decryption symbol exists (adjust to your runtime decrypt name if known)
# For generic check we look for a function or global that looks like a decrypt name; edit as appropriate:
# CHECK: @.buck_decrypt
