# Check that control flow flattening produced a dispatcher loop or switch-based dispatcher.
# This is a conservative check: we look for a switch instruction or a loop with a switch/indirect branch.

# CHECK: switch
# CHECK: br label
# CHECK: phi

# Alternatively look for an opaque dispatcher global / variable (pass-specific)
# CHECK: @dispatcher
